# NutriTest - Testing Suite for Nutrition Applications

## Why This Project?
As a developer transitioning from life sciences to tech, I created this testing suite to demonstrate:
- **Domain Knowledge**: Real nutrition calculations (BMI, TDEE, Macros)
- **Testing Skills**: 85% coverage with meaningful tests
- **Clean Code**: TypeScript, proper error handling, edge cases

## What Makes This Unique?
This isn't just another testing demo - it's a real-world application of testing principles on actual nutrition algorithms used in health apps.

## Real-World Features Tested:
-  BMI calculation with WHO categories
-  TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) using Mifflin-St Jeor
-  Macronutrient distribution for different fitness goals
-  Hydration calculator based on weight and activity
-  Meal planning component with real-time macro tracking

## My Testing Approach:
1. **Unit Tests**: Core nutrition calculations
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
3. **Edge Cases**: Invalid inputs, boundary values
4. **Real Scenarios**: Based on actual user data patterns
